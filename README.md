## The Problem
- Students (especially freshmen) may have difficulty navigating the campus
- Prospective students and families visiting campus could get lost without a guide
- Due to shape of certain buildings on campus, determining whether you're at the right building on Google Maps is difficult
## Our Solution
- Build a smartphone app to help guide people!
- App displays names and information about buildings on campus to help
- Activate by opening app and viewing building/landmark through camera
## How it works
- Connects to database with important buildings on campus  with details such as location, descriptions, and photos
- Uses compass and GPS data to figure out what building you are looking at
